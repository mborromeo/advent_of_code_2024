# AdventOfCode 2024

This is my attempt at the Advent of Code 2024.
I will be using Elixir for this challenge.

You can run the code in the IEx shell, with the runner script:
```
AdventOfCode.run(1)
```
where the argument is the day you want to run.

Otherwise you can build the project with
```
mix escript.build
```
and then run the executable with the day as an argument:
```
./advent_of_code 1
```

All the quizzes are solved in the `lib` directory, and the tests are in the `test` directory.

Please consider that this is my first time using Elixir, so the code might not be the most idiomatic :)
